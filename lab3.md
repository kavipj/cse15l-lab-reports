# Lab 3 Report

## Part 1

**1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown).**

**2. An input that doesn't induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown).**

**3. The symptom, as the output of running the two tests above (provide it as a screenshot -- one test should pass, one test should fail).**

**4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown).**

**5. Briefly describe (2-3 sentences) why the fix addresses the issue.**
